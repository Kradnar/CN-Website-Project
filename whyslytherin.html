            Although you may have heard a lot about how Slytherin students are always bad and that the House has a bad reputation, this is not the case. there are plenty of good wizards to also come from Slytherin house (see <a href="famousmembers.html">famous members</a> for a few examples) but due to the nature of the cunning and ambitious, these people are often considered harsher and don't help improve the reputaion of our great house.

            But what is the point of this website you ask, as the hat will sort you anyway, well it does also take your own choice into consideration, so please choose wisely (and pick Slytherin!) or maybe you're wondering what the point of the website is as only muggles use computers, that and Slytherin prefers pure-bloods, well thats a good point but we'd prefer a like minded mudblood to a blood-traitor any day.
