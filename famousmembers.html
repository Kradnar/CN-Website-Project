            <div>

                <br>
                The one part of his history that is not usually mentioned are Merlin's origins in Slytherin as the other houses will always go out of thier way to vilify the great house of Slytherin.

        <h4>Severus Snape</h4>

            <div>
                <p class="blkgrn  textspacing">Severus Snape was a very influential member of Slytherin house, a life long member (even wanting to be in Slytherin before even attending Hogwarts), he went on to become a master potion maker and gifted Legimens.
                <br>
                <br>
                Snape eventually applied for the "Defence against the Dark Arts" post at Hogwarts but instead was given the position of Potions Master, which he excelled at, he also became head of Slytherin House for a number of years.
                <br>
                <br>
                After the passing of Albus Dumbledore, Severus Snape took the Position of Headmaster for approximately a year before Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix started the Battle of Hogwarts which nearly destroyed the school and cost Severus his life.

            <div>
                <p class="blkgrn textspacing">A truly remarkable woman is Dolores Umbridge, a true Slytherin although to look at her you wouldn't think so, as she prefers to dress brightly.
                <br>
                <br>
                Raised from childhood as Slytherin, Delores graduated from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and soon rose in rank to become "Senior Undersecretary" to the Minister of Magic himself, during a time of educational reform in the failing Hogwarts school, Umbridge took on the position of "Defence against the Dark arks" professor where she revolutionised the subject.
                <br>
                <br>
                She then went on to become the 1st ever "High Inquisitor" and was tasked with routing out the weak elements of the teaching staff,  she did such an excellent job that she was promoted to Headmistress of the scholl in under a year.

            <img src= "images/slughorn-framed.png" width = "500px" alt = "Horace Slughorn">
            <div>
                <p class="blkgrn  textspacing">Horace Slughorn is a very influential Slytherin, he was Potions Master for a long time and during his time as a Professor at Hogwarts, he would host lavish parties for up and coming students which he had seen potential in,  this unfortunately often would include members of other houses as well as Slytherin, in these parties (which he referred to as "The Slug Club") he would invite former students to meet with and establish contacts with the current students in order to give them a step in the right direction.
                <br>
                <br>
                He retired and went on to live in a comfortable retirement (partially due to all the contact he had made) but returned to Hogwarts at the bequest of Albus Dumbledore in his final years and reassumed his positions of Potions master and Head of House after the battle of Hogwarts.

        <h4>Thomas Riddle</h4>
        <div class = "portraitalign">  <!-- Riddle Section -->
            <img src= "images/riddle-framed.png" width = "500px" alt = "Thomas Riddle">
            <div>
                <p class="blkgrn textspacing">Thomas Riddle is both one of the most well known wizards ever to come from Slytherin house and at the same time not many people will have ever heard of the name Thomas Riddle.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is mainly due to the fact that Thomas left his name behind during his time at Hogwarts and chose a new name which he is much better known by "Lord Voldemort".
                <br>
                <br>
                As Lord Voldemort, Riddle became the most powerful wizard known to the modern world, greater even that Gellert Grindlewald, he gained a following and even united the Giants and Dementers under his rule.  Unfortunately he met his end after being tricked by Harry Potter into letting his guard down by pretending to be dead and then taking the great Lord Voldemort by surprise.

            <div>
                <p class="blkgrn textspacing">One of our newest members, Draco is the son of Lucius Malfoy and the father of Scorpius Malfoy.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cursed to attend Hogwarts at the same time as the pretender Harry Potter, Draco had to endure all the simpering and special treatment that Harry was given,  when Draco objected, he was treated as the enemy and constantly vilified, (much like Slytherin in general), Draco even offered to help Potter to take the right path in his very 1st year mentioning, "There are all sorts of the wrong sorts of people in here,  I can help you with that" but had his kind offer refused.
                <br>
                <br>
                Draco went on in later life to become a prominent member of the Ministry of Magic, married Astoria Greengrass and has one son in Scorpius
